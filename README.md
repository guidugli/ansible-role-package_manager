    pm_apt_upgrade_command: dist

For APT only: can be dist, full, yes or safe

    pm_apk_upgrade_available: no

If set to yes, during upgrade, prefer replacing or downgrading packages (instead of holding them) if the currently installed package is no longer available from any repository.

    pm_install_packages: "{{ default_packages['install']['COMMON'] |

                        default([], true) + default_packages['remove'][ansible_os_family] | default([], true) }}"

Packages to remove: default list is based on CIS recommendations of software to uninstall if not used. Check `vars/main.yml` for the list of packages of each operating system. By default it will remove specialized software that may run on a server like samba, nfs, http server, etc, since most installation donÂ´t use them, and they may act as a vector for vulnerabilities. Ensure you review and adjust the list on each system.

    #  pm_gpgcheck_excludes:
    #    - /etc/yum.repos.d/virtio-win
